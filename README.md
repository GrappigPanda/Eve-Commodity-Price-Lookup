Eve Commodity Price Lookup
=================

An implementation of the Eve Central API (in Python) used to fetch commodity 
prices. At the current stage of development, it retrieves prices from mostly the 
four main trading hubs.

TODO:

1.) Add additional system price lookups
2.) Ensure that CostAnalysis.py retrieves correct shipping cost information (using RF Freighting)
