Eve Commodity Price Lookup
=================

An implementation of the Eve Central API (in Python) used to fetch commodity 
prices. In its current stage of development, it searches for arbitrage opportunities
by leveraging the EC API and scanning between different trading hubs.

TODO:

1.) Add a front-end in Flask or Django
2.) Add additional key_lookups for my PlayerStats object system
3.) Not really part of this project, but add weights into SQL database
